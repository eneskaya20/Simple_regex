# Simple_regex

Purpose of this repository is to understand basic keywords and functions in the regex library and use them to practice. This Python script provides a range of functionalities for text analysis using regular expressions (regex). The script is designed to handle the following tasks in an efficient manner:

## Counting Words with "com" Subtext

The script counts the total number of occurrences of words that contain the subtext "com" within a given sentence or paragraph. This feature can be helpful in identifying the frequency of specific words or patterns in text.

## Extracting Email Addresses

Utilizing regex patterns, the script extracts all email addresses present in the given text. This functionality is valuable for quickly identifying and retrieving email addresses from a larger body of text.

## Replacing Date Format

The script searches for all occurrences of dates in the format "dd-mm-yyyy" and replaces them with the "MM/dd/yyyy" format using string formatting techniques. This feature enables easy conversion of dates between different formats in text.

## Converting Capitalized Words to Lowercase

The script identifies all capitalized words in the text and converts them to lowercase. This functionality proves useful in cases where uniformity in capitalization is desired or when comparing text with case-insensitive criteria.

## Detecting URLs

Using regular expressions, the script detects and extracts any URLs present in the given text. This capability facilitates the identification and handling of web addresses within a larger body of text.

## Searching for User Input String Occurrences

The script allows users to input a search string, and it searches for occurrences of that string within the given text. The script then prints out the matching sentences that contain the specified search string. This feature enables efficient searching and retrieval of relevant information within a text.

## Requirements

To run this script, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed on your system.
- The re module, which is usually included in the Python standard library.
